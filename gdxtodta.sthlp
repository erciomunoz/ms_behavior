{title:Description}


{cmd:gdxtodta} calls GAMS (through the operative system) to open a gdx file and save it as txt. It then imports this text file and save it as a dta file.

This is done because Stata does not read gdx files but can read csv or txt files. Hence, we can save our gdx file as txt to be imported in Stata. 

This can be done directly from GAMS or from within Stata by sending a command through the operative system as done here using the Stata command "shell" or "!". This command temporarily invoke the operating system to call gdxdump in GAMS. 

GDXDUMP is a tool to write scalars, sets, parameters (tables), variables and equations from a GDX file formatted as a GAMS program with data statements to standard output, GMS or CSV files. 
 

{title:Saved results}

{pstd}
{cmd:gdxtodta} saves the following files: 

- A txt file with a name starting with the word "dump" followed by the scenario name.
- A dta file with a name starting with "CGE Parameters" followed by the scenario name.
- A dta file with a name starting with "CGE Sets" followed by the scenario name.
- A dta file with a name starting with "CGE Variables" followed by the scenario name.
- Only one of these three dta files is saved when the option sets, parameters, or variables are used.
